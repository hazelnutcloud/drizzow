# Progress: drizzle-uow

## Current Status: Initial Setup Phase

### What's Complete
1. **Project Structure**

2. **Documentation**
   - Clear specification in `spec.md`
   - API examples showing desired behavior
   - Type declarations demonstrating the interface
   
3. **Memory Bank**
   - All core memory bank files created
   - Project requirements documented
   - Architecture patterns defined
   - Technical approach outlined

### What Works
- Basic project setup with Bun
- TypeScript configuration
- Memory bank system for project continuity

### What Needs to Be Built

#### Core Implementation
1. **createUow Function**

   - [ ] Original value preservation
   - [ ] Dirty checking logic

4. **Query Integration**
   - [ ] Wrap Drizzle query methods
   - [ ] Return proxied results
   - [ ] Maintain type safety
   - [ ] Support all query types

5. **CRUD Operations**
   - [ ] Implement `create()` method
   - [ ] Implement `delete()` method
   - [ ] Track new entities
   - [ ] Track deleted entities
   - [ ] Handle entity relationships
   - [ ] ID generation strategy

6. **Save Mechanism**
   - [ ] Change set computation
   - [ ] Query building
   - [ ] Transaction management
   - [ ] Error handling

7. **Checkpoint System**
   - [ ] State snapshots
   - [ ] Rollback mechanism
   - [ ] Memory efficiency
   - [ ] Error reporting
   - [ ] Checkpoint-based save functionality

8. **Identity Map Pattern**
   - [ ] Entity uniqueness enforcement
   - [ ] Entity caching system
   - [ ] Reference consistency
   - [ ] Performance optimization

#### Database Support
1. **Adapter System**
   - [ ] Generic adapter interface
   - [ ] PostgreSQL adapter
   - [ ] MySQL adapter
   - [ ] SQLite adapter
   - [ ] Transaction handling per DB

2. **Type Compatibility**
   - [ ] Generic database types
   - [ ] Schema type preservation
   - [ ] Query builder types
   - [ ] Result type mapping

#### Testing Infrastructure
1. **Unit Tests**
   - [ ] Proxy behavior tests
   - [ ] Change tracking tests
   - [ ] Type inference tests
   - [ ] Checkpoint tests

2. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] SQLite integration
   - [ ] PostgreSQL integration
   - [ ] MySQL integration
   - [ ] Transaction tests

3. **Type Tests**
   - [ ] Type preservation checks
   - [ ] Generic constraint tests
   - [ ] API surface validation

#### Developer Experience
1. **Error Messages**
   - [ ] Clear error types
   - [ ] Actionable messages
   - [ ] Debugging helpers
   - [ ] Stack trace integration

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Usage examples
   - [ ] Migration guide
   - [ ] Best practices

3. **Tooling**
   - [ ] Build configuration
   - [ ] Publishing setup
   - [ ] Development scripts
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline

### Known Issues
- No implementation exists yet
- Need to determine best approach for database adapter detection
- Performance implications of proxy usage unknown
- Memory management strategy needs research

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Use JavaScript Proxies** for transparent change tracking
2. **Support ALL Drizzle databases**, not just SQLite
3. **Maintain Drizzle's API** while extending it
4. **TypeScript-first** development approach
5. **Bun as primary runtime** for development

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. How to detect database type from Drizzle instance
2. Best approach for handling nested proxies
3. Transaction API differences between databases
4. Memory management for large datasets
5. Batch operation optimization strategies

### Risk Areas
1. **Type System Complexity**: Preserving Drizzle's types through proxy layer
2. **Performance**: Proxy overhead for large datasets
3. **Database Variations**: Different transaction APIs
4. **Memory Usage**: Tracking many entities
5. **Edge Cases**: Circular references, complex relationships

### Next Milestone
**MVP Implementation** - Basic working version with:
- createUow function
- Simple proxy tracking
- Basic save() functionality
- Support for at least one database type
- Minimal test coverage

### Evolution Notes
- Started with SQLite example but clarified to support all databases
- Memory bank structure established for long-term development
- Focus on extensibility from the start
- Emphasis on maintaining Drizzle's excellent developer experience

### Development Philosophy
1. **Start Simple**: Get basic proxy tracking working first
2. **Test Early**: Set up testing infrastructure alongside implementation
3. **Type Safety**: Ensure types work correctly from the beginning
4. **Iterate**: Build MVP then enhance based on real usage
5. **Document**: Keep memory bank updated with learnings
